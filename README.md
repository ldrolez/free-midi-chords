# SHLD Free MIDI Chord Packs

Now over than 8800 MIDI files! This is a collaborative project to create a collection of all chords
and useful chord progressions in all keys, as MIDI files, usable
with your favorite DAW.

This collection is FREE and you can contribute to it using the issue tracker above.
Please use the bug tracker if you find incorrect chords! 

All the MIDI files are licensed under the MIT license, and **you can them use in any musical project freely**.

## Contents

In the file free-midi-chords-YYYYMMDD, the chords collection is organized using 4 levels of directories:

 * 1st level: All 12 Major and Minor keys
   * 2nd level: 
     * 1 Triads
       * 3rd level: Major and Minor scales
     * 2 7ths and 9ths chords
       * 3rd level: Major and Minor scales
     * 3 All other chords
       * 3rd level: Major and Minor scales
     * 4 Chord progressions
       * 3rd level: Major and Minor scales
         * 4th level: Rhythmic variations 

Below the progressions directory, you'll find 3 more directories. They contain the same MIDI chord progressions files but with different timings: basic4 style, alt4 style and hiphop style.

In the file free-midi-progressions-YYYYMMDD, you'll find only chord progressions in all the keys in a single directory. This way it's easier to import them in your Akai MPC, Roland MC-707 or MC-101 for example.
